Simply followed along with [this fantastic guide](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) by Peter Shirley!

Currently (12/19/24) doesn't contain any substantial differences, but I'm hoping to make lots of my own changes (!), as I learn from Parallel Processing this semester.
- Will check out [the next part](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingTheNextWeek.html)
- Might check out [the extension](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingTheRestOfYourLife.html) or other materials in their [further readings](https://github.com/RayTracing/raytracing.github.io/wiki/Further-Readings)
- Will check out [the GPU version](https://github.com/RayTracing/gpu-tracing) whenever it's finished; otherwise, would love to apply any techniques I learn in Parallel to this (even though I know it isn't Graphics)
